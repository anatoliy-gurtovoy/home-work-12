                <p>
                    Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                    instructions, they've
                    moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,

                <p>
                    React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the
                    app platform‚Äôs
                    native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to
                    describe the
                    appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <em> bundles of reusable, nestable
                        code</em>. You
                    can
                    learn more about
                    React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.
                </p>

                <h2>react fundamentals <span>Chapter 3</span></h2>
                <p>React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                    JavaScript.
                    To make the most
                    of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve
                    as a
                    refresher
                    course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                </p>

                <p>
                    + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                    approachable
                    creatures that
                    need names and a cafe to work in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like
                    so:
                    <Text>Hello, I
                        am your cat!</Text>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
                    JavaScript, you can
                    use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with
                    curly
                    braces inside
                    <Text>
                </p>

                <p>
                    + props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                </p>

                <p>
                    + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state
                    is
                    like a
                    component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
                    comes from user
                    interaction. State gives your components memory!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>handling text input <span>Chapter 4</span></h2>
                <p>
                    TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that
                    takes a function to
                    be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
                    called when the text is
                    submitted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language. In this new
                    language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
                    translated as "üçï
                    üçï".
